title: Aurora accepted to HotOS 2021
---

Our paper on the Aurora Single Level Store OS was accepted to HotOS 2021! Aurora takes care of persistence on behalf of the application, allowing developers to write code as if the system never crashes. Aurora ensures system crashes are invisible to the application by creating executable images through continuous checkpointing.

In this paper we describe how executable application images are used as a building block for applications.
