title: Aurora accepted to SOSP 2021
---

I am very happy to announce that our work on the Aurora Single Level Store has been accepted at SOSP 2021! In this paper we focus on how we achieve high checkpointing frequencies to get fine granularity persistence. The full paper is [here](assets/pdf/aurora-sosp.pdf). We also have a short [video](https://rcs.uwaterloo.ca/~etsal/aurora-sosp.mp4) outlining Aurora's design, our motivation, and the POSIX object model we use for checkpointing.
